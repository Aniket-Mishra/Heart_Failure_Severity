Age: number
Sex: Binary (male=1)
Cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
Trestbps: resting BP (in mm HG)
Cholesterol: serum cholestrol in mg/dl
Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl (1=yes)
RestECG: 0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy
Thalach: max heart rate achieved
Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: slope of the peak exercise 
Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

num0 = level 0 heart failure (no HF)
num1 = level 1 heart failure
num2 = level 2 heart failure
num3 = level 3 heart failure
num4 = level 4 heart failure (most severe)
Output: severity of heart failure on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being no HF, and 4 being the heighest severity of HF.
